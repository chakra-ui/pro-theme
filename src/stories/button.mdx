# Button

One of the major elements that we have modified in the Chakra UI Pro theme compared to the Chakra UI default theme is the `Button` component.

The size of the buttons in the Chakra UI Pro theme have been revised and they differ from those in the Chakra UI default theme. Below is a comparison of the button sizes in pixel height.

### Size Comparison

| Size | Default Theme | Pro Theme |
| ---- | ------------- | --------- |
| 2xs  | Not Available | 24px      |
| xs   | 24px          | 32px      |
| sm   | 32px          | 36px      |
| md   | 40px          | 40px      |
| lg   | 48px          | 44px      |
| xl   | Not Available | 48px      |
| 2xl  | Not Available | 60px      |

Please note that these changes have been made to provide a more distinct and aesthetically pleasing set of button sizes that cater to a wider range of design needs.
